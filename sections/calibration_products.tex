\section{Calibration Products Pipeline (\wbsCPP)}

\subsection{Key Requirements}

The work performed in this WBS serves two complementary roles:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{It will enable the production of calibration data products as required by the Level 2 Photometric Calibration Plan (\NewPCP{}) and other planning documents \cite{Lupton15}\footnote{Resolving contradictions between these documents is out of scope here.}. This includes both characterization of the sensitivity of the LSST system (optics, filters and detector) and the transmissivity of the atmosphere.}
  \item{It will characterize of detector anomalies in such a way that they can be corrected either by the instrument signature removal routines in the Single Frame Processing Pipeline (\wbsSFM) or, if appropriate, elsewhere in the system;}
  \item{It will manage and provide a catalog of optical ghosts and glints to other parts of the system upon demand.}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Inputs}

The following lists input datasets which will be available to the Calibration Products Pipeline. It should be noted that these are the raw inputs, and as such, the algorithmic sections for items that are listed as camera team deliverables are shown as ``None'', as these will already have been derived. However, many of these items are re-listed in the outputs section (\ref{sec:calibrationOutputDatasets}), where the algorithms to recalculate/monitor these on the mountain are discussed.


\subsubsection{Bias Frames}\label{inputs:biases} 
Sets of bias frames for the production of master biases.
\alg None - these just need to be taken.


\subsubsection{Gain Values}\label{inputs:gain} 
\cameraTeam
Gain values for all amplifiers;  note that these are required to high accuracy (0.1\%), as they are used while determining the photometric flats.
\alg Determination is subtle but not hard; both \fefiftyfive\ and PTC gain measurement techniques need to be applied with some care to get good results. Given the \bfeffect\ and non-linearity, it's not clear to what accuracy PTC can give gains, but \fefiftyfive\ can certainly provide gain to $\ll$0.1\% 


\subsubsection{Linearity}\label{inputs:linearityCurve} 
\cameraTeam
The linearity curve for every amplifier.
\alg None.


\subsubsection{Darks}\label{inputs:dark}
Sets of 300s dark frames.
\alg None - these just need to be taken.


\subsubsection{Crosstalk}\label{inputs:crosstalk}
\cameraTeam
The crosstalk matrix for every pair of amplifiers in the camera.
\alg None.


\subsubsection{Defect Map}\label{inputs:defectList} 
\cameraTeam
A list of all bad pixels in each CCD.
\alg None.


\subsubsection{Saturation levels}\label{inputs:saturationLevel}
\cameraTeam
The level (in electrons (or ADU?)), for each amplifier, at which charge bleeds to a neighbouring pixel. 
\alg None.


\subsubsection{Broadband Flats}\label{inputs:broadFlat}
Sets of flats taken through the standard LSST filters.  We will	need flats taken at a number of flux levels to measure brighter-fatter and check linearity.
\alg None - these just need to be taken.


\subsubsection{Monochromatic Flats}\label{inputs:monoFlat}
Sets of `monochromatic' (\c 1nm) flat-field screen images taken without the filter in the beam.
\alg None - these just need to be taken.


\subsubsection{CBP Data}\label{inputs:CBP}
Sets of \textit{C}ollimated \textit{B}eam \textit{P}rojector images. The proposed resolutions and steps in these datasets are preliminary.
\alg Scripting the CBP/8.4m to take each of these datasets in concert. The scripting/control requirements for the CBP are dealt with separately in \ref{CBP_control}.


\paragraph{CBP dataset 1}\label{inputs:CBP:mono}
Sets of CBP images scanned in wavelength at 1nm resolution every 1nm for a fixed set of spot positions on the camera, and for fixed footprint on M1.  No filter should be in the beam.
	
	
\paragraph{CBP dataset 2}\label{inputs:CBP:spot}
Sets of CBP images scanned in wavelength at 20nm resolution every 100nm, while rotating the CBP about a pupil to move the spot pattern around the camera for a fixed footprint on M1.  No filter should be in the beam.

	
\paragraph{CBP dataset 3}\label{inputs:CBP:M1}
Sets of CBP images scanned in wavelength at 20nm resolution every 100nm for a fixed set of spot positions on the camera, and for a number of footprints on M1; the minimum number of footprints is \c 6 for a 30cm CBP, but in reality we will explore more pointings to test azimuthal symmetry. No filter should be in the beam.


\paragraph{CBP dataset 4}\label{inputs:CBP:filter}
Sets of CBP images scanned in wavelength at 1nm resolution every 1nm for a fixed set of spot positions on the camera, and for fixed footprint on M1.  Repeated for every filter. \Nb the wavelength range for each scan need only cover the range for which the filter transmits appreciable light.


\paragraph{CBP dataset 5}\label{inputs:CBP:leak}
Sets of CBP images scanned in wavelength at 20nm resolution every 20nm for a fixed set of spot positions on the camera, and for fixed footprint on M1. Repeated for every filter.


\paragraph {CBP Crosstalk}\label{inputs:CBP:crosstalk}
Sets of CBP images taken with a suitable designed sparse mask to allow us to identify and measure all crosstalk images.  The simplest sparse mask would have only a single spot, used to illuminate each amplifier in the camera in turn (but less sparse solutions are probably also possible).  The wavelengths used are unimportant, and there are no constraints on beam footprints on M1 or filter choice.


\subsubsection{Filter Transmission}\label{inputs:filterTransmission}
\cameraTeam
Transmission curves for all the filters as a function of position.
\alg None.


\subsubsection{Stellar spectra}\label{inputs:starSpectrum} 
Spectrophotometrically-calibrated spectra for stars in the field of view for almost all visits.
\alg xxx Need to write this. Could potentially involve Team Stubbs/Guyonnet though.


\subsubsection{Other stellar spectra (\nb~!= \ref{inputs:starSpectrum})}\label{inputs:standardStarSpectrum}
Known spectra for bright stars in the field of view of all visits.
\alg xxx Need to write this. Could potentially involve Team Stubbs/Guyonnet though.


\subsubsection{Atmospheric Characterisation}\label{inputs:atmosphericData}
Externally measured parameters of the atmosphere, for example barometric pressure and ozone.
\alg None, except for interfacing with the site team or whoever is responsible for the equipment to automate getting these readings from the environmental monitors.


\subsubsection{Photometric Standards}\label{inputs:photometricStandards} 
Photometric standards, of a range of colours. GAIA is a likely source for these data.
\alg None.

\subsection{Outputs from LSST's Calibration Product Pipelines \\
	/ Inputs to Alert/DRP Pipelines}
\label{sec:calibrationOutputDatasets}

This section details the output from the Calibration Products Pipeline. Algorithms for the production of each item are discussed in detail, and includes the re-derivation of the items previously just listed as camera team deliverables.

\subsubsection{Master Bias}\label{calibProducts:bias}
Trimmed, overscan subtracted, bias frame for each CCD.
\alg Construction algorithm exists in \texttt{pipe\_drivers}.

\subsubsection{Master Darks}\label{calibProducts:dark}
Trimmed, overscan subtracted, dark frame scaled to 1 second for each CCD.
\alg Construction algorithm exists in \texttt{pipe\_drivers}.


\subsubsection{Master Linearity}\label{calibProducts:linearityCurve}
Linearity curves; identical to \ref{inputs:linearityCurve}, unless updated during operations.
\alg  Will need to write algorithmic component to generate the linearity curves from raw data. Requires careful treatment as \bfeffect can masquerade as non-linearity. Code to apply non-linearity curves during \texttt{isr} is currently being implemented by Russel Owen for \texttt{obs\_decam}.


\subsubsection{Master Fringe Frames}\label{calibProducts:fringeFrames}
Some variety of fringe frames. We hope that we will not need these, but should plan for their existence as a backup.
\alg Construction of these fringe frames from \hyperref[inputs:monoFlat]{monochromatic flats} using existing algorithm in \texttt{pipe\_drivers}.


\subsubsection{Master Gain Values}\label{calibProducts:gains}
Per-amplifier gains; identical to \ref{inputs:gain}, unless updated during operations.
\alg Potentially difficult. We will have almost arbitrarily accurate gain measurements as an input, but monitoring the evolution of these gains to the required accuracy is currently an unsolved problem. Ticket \hyperref{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-6030}{}{}{\texttt{DM-6030}} exists to explore the possibility of using cosmic ray muons and radioisotope contamination in the camera for this purpose. If this fails (likelihood moderate-high) then another method will need to be devised.

\subsubsection{Master Defects}\label{calibProducts:defectList}
A list of all bad pixels in each CCD; identical to \ref{calibProducts:defectList}, unless updated during operations.     
\alg Statistical analysis of dark frames, flats and ``pocket-pumping" exposures will determine the defect list.


\subsubsection{Saturation Levels}\label{calibProducts:saturationLevel}
The level (in electrons (or ADU? xxx)), for each amplifier, at which charge bleeds to a neighbouring pixel; identical to \ref{calibProducts:saturationLevel}, unless updated during operations.     
\alg Easily measurable with the CBP, but need to code to detect leakage and calculate threshold level. %\rednote{Does bleeding occur in the serial register? If not, why do we expect it to be a per-amplifier thing? Could it potentially not be a per-pixel effect? This is surely known, but I should discuss with someone.}


\subsubsection{Crosstalk}\label{calibProducts:crosstalk}
The crosstalk matrix for every pair of amplifiers in the camera; identical to \ref{calibProducts:crosstalk}, unless updated during operations.
\alg The validity of \ref{calibProducts:crosstalk} is questionable to the extent where it is not clear whether it should even be a \textbf{Camera Team deliverable}. We must be able to measure this on the mountain using the CBP. The involves dithering one or more spot masks around the focal plane and measuring the coefficients. Should be highly multiplexable using a multi-pinhole mask. Need code to extract the crosstalk coefficients from these measurements.


\subsubsection{\emph{Im}pure Monochromatic Flats}\label{calibProducts:monoFlat}
Sets of `monochromatic' (\c 1nm) trimmed, overscan subtracted, flat-field images for each filter.  These flats will \textit{include} ghost and scattered light.
\alg Construction algorithm likely almost exists in \texttt{pipe\_drivers}.


\subsubsection{Pure Monochromatic Flats}\label{calibProducts:monoPhotoFlat}
Sets of `monochromatic' (\c 1nm) trimmed, overscan subtracted, flat-field images for each filter.  These flats will \textit{exclude} ghost and scattered light.
\alg Constructed from \ref{calibProducts:monoPhotoFlat} and the ghost catalogue / system optical model.


\subsubsection{PhotoFlats}\label{calibProducts:standardPhotoFlat}
The linear combination of \ref{calibProducts:monoPhotoFlat} data weighted by a flat-spectrum source (or other defined standard SED), absorbed by a standard atmosphere.
\alg Combination of \ref{calibProducts:monoPhotoFlat} should be simple; need to define the ``standard atmosphere".


\subsubsection{Low-res narrow-band flats}\label{calibProducts:monoPhotoFlatLowRes}
A low-resolution (in both space and wavelength) version of  \ref{calibProducts:monoPhotoFlat}.
\alg \rednote{Not clear to me a) why these exist and b) what a low spatial resolution flat means. Construction shouldn't be hard though.}


\subsubsection{Pixel Sizes}\label{calibProducts:pixelSizeMap} 
A map of the pixel-size distortions.  At worse, this will be a $n_{\mbox{width}}\times n_{\mbox{height}}\times 2$ datacube of floats.
\alg Algorithm to measure this is currently a (somewhat) unsolved problem. It has been shown by Aaron Roodman \& co. that these can be measured from flat-fields, but the problem is under-constrained, and thus the stability (nay, validity) of their measurements is questionable, despite seeming to work. Further thought is required to establish whether their method can be used, and if not, devise another one (though it is not obvious how the problem can be made to be well constrained). 


\subsubsection{Brighter-fatter Coefficients}\label{calibProducts:brighterFatterCoeffs}
Coefficients needed to model the brighter-fatter effects. We hope that these are a small number of floats per CCD, but this is not yet entirely clear.
\alg A number of techniques to measure these exist (mostly developed by members of the DESC SAWG). One or more of these will need to be implemented in the DM framework.

\subsubsection{Filter Transmission}\label{calibProducts:filterTransmission}
Measurement of filter transmission, measure \emph{in-situ}. As well as the filter transmission from the camera team in \ref{inputs:filterTransmission}, we further baseline the development of a procedure for measuring the filter response at 1\,nm resolution using the approach described in \cite{Lupton15}.


\subsubsection{Ghost catalog}\label{calibProducts:GhostCatalog}
A catalog of optical ghosts and glints which is available for use in other parts of the system. Detailed characterization of ghosts in the LSST system will only be possible when the system is operational. Our baseline design therefore calls for this system to be prototyped using data from precursor instrumentation; we note that ghosts in \eg HSC are well known and more significant than are expected in LSST.
\begin{note}
It is not currently clear where the responsibility for characterizing ghosts and glints in the system lies. We assume it is outwith this WBS.

\subsection{CBP Control}\label{CBP_control}
The procurement of the CBP includes the procurement of the necessary control software  \rednote{Check with Patrick Ingraham that this is correct}. However, it will still remain to write scripts for the CBP and interfaces with the OCS to allow making all of the desired measurements, especially as several of these, namely \rednote{xxx, xxx \& xxx} require doing so in concert with the 8.4m.

\subsection{Calibration Telescope Input Data}
\label{sec:calibrationTelescopeDatasets}
This section details to input data required to calibrate the calibration (auxiliary/Calypso) telescope itself.


\subsubsection{}\label{calypso:atmosphericAbsorption} The atmospheric absorption as a function of wavelength (at
moderate spectral resolution) for almost each visit.
\subsubsection{}\label{calypso:nightSkySpectrum} Spectrum of the night sky near the Calypso boresight, with $R
\sim 200$.\footnote{It is not entirely clear whether these will be taken on the Calypso or 8.4m	boresight.}



\subsection{Calibration Telescope Output Data}
\label{sec:calibrationTelescopeDatasets}
This section details the calibrated outputs from the calibration (auxiliary/Calypso) telescope, which, like items in section \ref{sec:calibrationOutputDatasets}, are output from to the Calibration Products Pipelines to be used in photometric calibration at various levels.


\subsubsection{}\label{calypso:atmosphericAbsorption}
The atmospheric absorption as a function of wavelength (at moderate spectral resolution) for almost each visit.
\subsubsection{}\label{calypso:nightSkySpectrum}
Spectrum of the night sky near the Calypso boresight, with $R\sim 200$.\footnote{It is not entirely clear whether these will be taken on the Calypso or 8.4m boresight.}

\Nb these are clearly not raw data, but will need to be extracted from spectrographic exposures.
\XXX{Add a description of those pipelines, and of the input data that they require.}

\subsection{Prototype Implementation}

While parts of the Calibration Products Pipeline have been prototyped by the LSST Calibration Group (see the \NewPCP for discussion), these have not been written using LSST Data Management software framework or coding standards. We therefore expect to transfer the know-how, and rewrite the implementation.













\subsection{Overview of calibration procedure}
This section, whilst not strictly concerning the \emph{production} of the calibration products themselves, aims to give a broad overview of how these products will be used and why. 
\begin{note}
Whilst this isn't technically part of the CPP remit, without it, all that is here is a list of ingredients, (and how to make the compound ingredients), with no overview of the recipe, which makes for a strange section in a cookbook. If this is no desired or should live somewhere else then feel free to move or \emph{re}move it, but I felt like it should be in here as this stuff is not easy to get ones head around at the best of times.
\end{note}

Overview goes here! xxx

%\paragraph{Instrumental sensitivity}
%
%
%
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item{Record bias/dark frames;}
%  \item{Use ``monochromatic'' (1\,nm) flat field screen flats with no filter in the beam to measure the per-pixel sensitivity;}
%  \item{Use a collimated beam projector (CBP) to measure the quantum efficiency (QE) at a set of points in the focal plane, dithering those points to tie them together;}
%  \item{Combine the screen and CBP data to determine the broad band (10--100\,nm) QE of all pixels;}
%  \item{Fold in the filter response to determine the 1\,nm resolution effective QE of all pixels.}
%\end{enumerate}
%
%This WBS is responsible for the development of the data analysis algorithms and software required and the ultimate delivery of the flat fields. Development and commissioning of the CBP itself, together with any other infrastructure required to perform the above procedure, lies outwith Data Management (see 04C.08 \emph{Calibration System}).
%
%\paragraph{Atmospheric transmissivity}
%
%Measurements from the auxiliary instrumentation---to include the 1.2\,m ``Calypso'' telescope, a bore-sight mounted radiometer and satellite-based measurement of atmospheric parameters such as pressure and ozone---will be used to determine the atmospheric absorption along the line of sight to standard stars. The atmospheric transmission will be decomposed into a set of basis functions and interpolated in space in time to any position in the LSST focal plane.
%
%This WBS will develop a pipeline for accurate spectrophotometric measurement of stars with the auxiliary telescope. We expect to repurpose and build upon publicly available code e.g.\ from the PFS\footnote{Subaru's Prime Focus Spectrograph; \url{http://sumire.ipmu.jp/pfs/}.} project for this purpose.
%
%This WBS will construct the atmospheric model, which may be based either on \textsc{modtran} (as per \NewPCP{}) or a PCA-like decomposition of the data (suggested by \cite{Lupton15}).
%
%This WBS will define and develop the routine for fitting the atmospheric model to each exposure from the calibration telescope and providing estimates of the atmospheric transmission at any point in the focal plane upon request.
%
%\paragraph{Detector effects}
%
%An initial cross-talk correction matrix will be determined by laboratory measurements on the Camera Calibration Optical Bench (CCOB). However, to account for possibile instabilities, this WBS will develop an on-telescope method. We baseline this as being based on measurement with the CBP, but we note the alternative approach based on cosmic rays adopted by HSC \cite{Furusawa14}.
%
%Multiple reflections between the layers of the CCD give rise to spatial variability with fine scale structure in images which may vary with time \cite[\S2.5.1]{Lupton15}. These can be characterized by white light flat-fields. Preliminary analysis indicates that these effects may be insignificant in LSST \cite{Rasmussen15}; however, the baseline calls for a routine developed in this WBS to analyse the flat field data and generate fringe frames on demand. This requirement may be relaxed if further analysis (outside the scope of this WBS) demonstrates it to be unnecessary.
%
%
%This WBS will develop algorithms to characterize and mitigate anomalies due to the nature of the camera's CCDs.
%
%\begin{note}
%There's a complex inter-WBS situation here: the actual mitigation of CCD anomalies will generally be performed in SFM (\wbsSFM{}), based on products provided by this WBS which, in turn, may rely on laboratory based research which is broadly outside the scope of DM\@. We baseline the work required to develop the corrective algorithms here. We consider moving it to \wbsSFM{} in future.
%\end{note}
%
%The effects we anticipate include:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item{QE variation between pixels;}
%  \item{Static non-uniform pixel sizes (e.g.\ ``tree rings'' \cite{Stubbs14});}
%  \item{Dynamic electric fields (e.g.\ ``brighter-fatter'' \cite{Antilogus14});}
%  \item{Time dependent effects in the camera (e.g.\ hot pixels, changing cross-talk coefficients);}
%  \item{Charge transfer (in)efficiency (CTE).}
%\end{itemize}
%
%Laboratory work required to understand these effects is outwith the scope of this WBS\@. In some cases, this work may establish that the impact of the effect may be neglected in LSST\@. The baseline plan addresses these issues through the following steps:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item{Separate QE from pixel size variations\footnote{Refer to work by Rudman.} and model both as a function of position (and possibly time);}
%  \item{Learn how to account for pixel size variation over the scale of objects (e.g.\ by redistributing charge);}
%  \item{Develop a correction for the brighter-fatter effect and develop models for any features which cannot be removed;}
%  \item{Handle edge/bloom using masking or charge redistribution;}
%  \item{Track defects (hot pixels);}
%  \item{Handle CTE, including when interpolating over bleed trails.}
%\end{itemize}
%
