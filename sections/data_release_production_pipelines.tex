\section{Data Release Production}

\begin{note}[Overview Diagram]
Collapse and summarize ``DRP Top-Level Overview'' on confluence along the lines of this outline, mostly by dropping the ``Task/Process'' boxes and merging data products with the same data units.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Data Products Table]
Table of data products with brief descriptions (including intermediates, so not just DPDD), expanding the groups defined in Overview Diagram
\end{note}

Brief summary of all Pipelines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with iteration between single-visit processing and joint calibration; iteration necessary to get consistent WCS/PSF, but also helpful to identify stars for PSF modeling.
\item Iteratively build coadds and detect differences between images.  Improve backgrounds, find artifacts, and define ``static sky'', then use this to detect transient/variable/moving astrophysical sources.
\item Detect on coadds, associate detections (inc. DIASources), and deblend on coadds.
\item Measure objects on coadds and individual epochs.
\item Measure selection functions, compute classifications, absorb level-3 contributions we depend on.  Highlight uncertainty.
\end{itemize}
